# Extra Curricular Activity Manager

## Problem Statement
Extra Curricular Activity Monitor: HoD Department of CSE is interested in building a web based application to monitor the extra curricular activities undertaken and executed by students in the department. Data should be collected about the activity and the effort required to complete the activity. Students should be able to initiate the recording of an activity but it should be validated by an academic supervisor to make it official. Based on the data collected suitable individual and group reports should be generated. Multiple suitable user roles should be able to operate the system.

## TODOs
* Add "create table" statements in create_students_table migration
* Add "create table" statements in create_staff_table migration
* Add "create table" statements in create_activities_table migration
